# lcom_proj_demo_video
This is a video o a project that I am particularly proud of, developed as a group project. It consists of a small game for the Minix operating system. The drivers for the timer, keyboard, mouse, RTC and serial port were developped by the two people involved in the project. The graphics were created by me.
